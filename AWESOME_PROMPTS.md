# Awesome Composer MCP prompts

_Collecting all the awesome ideas for how to use the Composer MCP server to share with the community._

1. Find the Composer symphonies with the highest alpha.
2. Find the Composer symphonies with better risk-adjusted return than Bitcoin while keeping risk under half of Bitcoin's over the same period. Filter out symphonies with returns below the S&P 500 over the same time period.
1. I want to compare my live performance for each symphony against the backtest over the same time period. I want to know which symphonies have deviated the most from their backtest. Return the results as a sorted table starting with the most severe underperformers.
1. Explain this symphony to me: https://app.composer.trade/symphony/3W80K6PVgou3IF93Un0N/details (replace URL with your symphony's factsheet).
